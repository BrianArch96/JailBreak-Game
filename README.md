# Jailbreak-Game
Game was made in lua and runs in Corona.
The game was inspired by a Professor Layton puzzle.
I made it in first year for a project.
Basically you are a prisoner trying to escape prison, in order to do you must outsmart the guards by not getting caught!
The guards move in accordance with you, everytime you move, they move! They have a designated move pattern so you have to carefully 
bide your time and work out a way to get by the guards and regain your freedom.
All pixel art is original and the music was composed by Kyle Landry.
In order to run the game, you must download the corona client and run the game through that player.
This project was my introduction to event listeners and lua.
